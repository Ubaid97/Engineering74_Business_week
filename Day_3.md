# Day 3
## Critical Thinking
- Helps create strong arguments by enabling one to justify claims with 
evidence
- Contributes to any role as it requires an ability to gather, analyse, 
and evaluate information
### Skills involved
- Actively seek out all sides of an argument
- Checking facts and evidence
- Responsing objectively
### Bloom's taxonomy
- Evaluate - Make judgements about the value of ideas/information
- Synthesise - Combine ideas/information into something new
- Analyse - Understand the different parts that make up the whole and 
how they relate to each other
- Apply - Apply theoretical knowledge in concrete scenarios
- Understand - Make sense of ideas/information
- Remember - Recall information
### 3 steps
- Identify
	- Main points of the argument
	- Claims being made
	- Evidence used
	- Conclusions reached
- Analyse
	- Does the information make sense in relation to other research?
	- How old is the material? (how relevant?)
	- Is the material clear or is additional information required to 
understand it?
	- Is the argument balanced or does it disregard certain topics?
- Apply and compare
	- Implications of other information
	- Weaknesses when applied to real-life information
	- A lack of coverage
### 3 modes of thinking
- Divergent - Imaginatively thinking of ideas in response to questions
- Convergent - Seeking facts to provide answers
- Lateral - Combination of divergent and convergent thinking
### Incorrect attitudes
- Ignorant certainty - Being convinced that one is correct despite in 
fact being ignorant
- Naive relativism - Believing that all arguments are equally valid
