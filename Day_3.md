# Day 3
## Critical Thinking
- Helps create strong arguments by enabling one to justify claims with 
evidence
- Contributes to any role as it requires an ability to gather, analyse, 
and evaluate information
### Skills involved
- Actively seek out all sides of an argument
- Checking facts and evidence
- Responsing objectively
### Bloom's taxonomy
- Evaluate - Make judgements about the value of ideas/information
- Synthesise - Combine ideas/information into something new
- Analyse - Understand the different parts that make up the whole and 
how they relate to each other
- Apply - Apply theoretical knowledge in concrete scenarios
- Understand - Make sense of ideas/information
- Remember - Recall information
### 3 steps
- Identify
	- Main points of the argument
	- Claims being made
	- Evidence used
	- Conclusions reached
- Analyse
	- Does the information make sense in relation to other research?
	- How old is the material? (how relevant?)
	- Is the material clear or is additional information required to 
understand it?
	- Is the argument balanced or does it disregard certain topics?
- Apply and compare
	- Implications of other information
	- Weaknesses when applied to real-life information
	- A lack of coverage
### 3 modes of thinking
- Divergent - Imaginatively thinking of ideas in response to questions
- Convergent - Seeking facts to provide answers
- Lateral - Combination of divergent and convergent thinking
### Incorrect attitudes
- Ignorant certainty - Being convinced that one is correct despite in 
fact being ignorant
- Naive relativism - Believing that all arguments are equally valid
### Enquiry based learning
- Learning which focuses on identifying the right questions to orient 
itself when looking for solutions
- The enquiry cycle
```
Reflect -> Enquire -> Investigate -> Create -> Discuss -> Reflect -> ...
```
### Things to consider in arguments
- What is the evidence provided?
- What is the source of this evidence?
- How clear are the points made?
- Strengths and weaknesses of the argument
- Is it a balanced argument?
- Is the evidence provided sufficient?
- Are examples given?
- Are causal links established?
### Basic argument structure
- Claim
	- Present the argument in a clear statement
- Evidence
	- Present evidence to back claims
- Impact
	- Explain the significance of the evidence

- Coherence
	- Are the claims logically consistent (not contradictory)?
	- Do the claims rely on unjustified assumptions?
	- Have all alternatives been considered
- Supporting evidence
	- Are the claims based on opinion or supported by evidence?
	- What is the source of the evidence?
	- Is the evidence appropriate for the topic?
	- Does the provided evidence conflict or complement other 
evidence
### Debating etiquettes
- Acknowledge opposition's view before challenging. Make an effort to 
understand their viewpoint
- Be constructive in your criticism, not just dismissive
- Reflect on the strengths of the opposition's argument
- Be respectful in your speech and conduct
### Logical fallacies
- False dichotomy - Forcing the debate into a choice 
between two mutually exclusive options, when in fact other options are 
available
- Assertion - Presenting a claim as fact without providing justification
- Straw man - Falsely attributing an argument to your opponent and then 
rebutting it to strengthen your own argument
- Contradiction - Claim being made is incosnsistent with other claims 
made or the assumptions on which they're based
### The art of persuasion - Three pillars of rhetoric
- Ethos - Appealing to one's own authority/credibility, or to the values 
of the audience
- Pathos - Appealing to the emotional empathy of the audience
- Logos - Providing reasons that the audience will find compelling
